Usage:

  Move the file into ~/.vim/syntax/ if it exists.

  Copy the following lines into ~/.vimrc:

    augroup info
       autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.info set filetype=drupal-info
      autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.make set filetype=drupal-info
    augroup END

    Open a .info file and gaze thunderstruck at the colors.

Note:

  This vim syntax plugin should work for Drupal 6 as well, as always, YMMV.
